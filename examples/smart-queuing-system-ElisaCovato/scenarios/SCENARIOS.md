# Scenarios
This folder contains all the files for the  _three_ different scenarios:
- Scenario 1: [Manufacturing Sector](manufacturing/MANUFACTURING.md)
- Scenario 2: [Retail Sector](retail/RETAIL.md)
- Scenario 3: [Transportation Sector](transportation/TRANSPORTATION.md)

The scenarios depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

All the scenarios involve people in queues, but each of them requires different hardware for the system to be deployed.

The initial choice of hardware, and the following validation/update after building and testing the app, is documented in `hardware_choice.docx`.
